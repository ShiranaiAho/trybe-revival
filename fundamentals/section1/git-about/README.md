It's my first git repository!! (That's a lie, cause i already learned it, but i forgot everything T-T)

I need to learn English, so I'll write everything in English, trying to improve the language. (Sorry if there are any mistakes, I'm studying :D)

# Day 2 - Git: Creating a repository

### Creating a versionate project! - Step by Step (by me)

1 - Create your folder and start git, with [git init]
2 - Create a branch for a new feature, with [git checkout -b <branch-name>]
3 - Make your changes, and when finished, add them to the stage, with [git add .]
4 - Make a commit, explaning your changes with a message , with [git commit -m "message"]
5 - When you're done (make sure everything is right), merge this branch with your main branch, with [git merge <branch-name>]
